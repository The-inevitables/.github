## What are we? üßô

*A group of techies trying to solve complex problems by participating in various hackthons and trying to bring ideas to life.* <br/>
We constantly look for new challenges and topics rather than fixating on the tech stack we know. And of course, the ultimate aim is to give something back to society.
